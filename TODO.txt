TODO list

- move the new Embedding (Embedding + ParamBuffer in one class) and the ModelParser (containing the Model dependency) to a new repo, where it can be imported from both platforms and the backends
- resolve the Model instructions (alloc, quinstruct) to contain the logic for vparams, fparams, tparams(?)
- add docstrings
