# Qadence 2 Platforms

Qadence 2 Platforms is a collection of functionalities that transforms [Qadence IR](https://github.com/pasqal-io/qadence2-ir/) into backend-specific data and constructors, to be executed by backend methods. It is not intended to be used directly by [Qadence 2](https://github.com/pasqal-io/qadence2-core/) users, but rather those who need to implement or extend backends, quantum instruction primitives, compiler or backend directives, etc.
