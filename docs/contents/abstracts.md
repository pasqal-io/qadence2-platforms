# Abstracts objects

This module defines the bare bone of the Qadence 2 platforms. The [`AbstractInterface`](../api/abstracts.md) sets all the necessary methods that must be shared by all the backends in order to function properly when the user runs `expectation`  or `sample` method, for instance, for a given expression. Additional `Enum` classes are defined as well to enable the user to choose the right flags on the methods calls.
